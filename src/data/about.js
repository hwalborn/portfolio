  content: "Born and raised in Kentucky, I constantly pushed myself to find new ways of forward thinking. Coding came as a challenge at a young age, teaching myself what I realize now was basic HTML. During that same time, I began developing an unstoppable passion for dance. I dropped everything I was doing to throw myself into classical training. Knowing that arts education was limited in Kentucky, I transferred to Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan to study dance as a full time student in a high school for the arts. After graduating high school, I attended Butler University where I graduated with a BFA in Dance Performance in 2010. Following graduation, I moved to New York City where I had a distinguished career as a professional dancer."

    content: "As a recent graduate of the Flatiron School in Manhattan, I am on the hunt for a job. As far as technical skills go, I write in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, SQL, React, Redux, Sinatra, and several other frameworks/languages. I understand full stack web development and object oriented programming. Beyond the job search, I enjoy solving code challenges and creating basic web applications. I love breaking things, then figuring out how to fix it.  Talk to me about code or dancing or life. I consider myself easy to talk to and appreciate good conversation about almost anything. Finding solace in the chaos of a career transition has proved to be quite enjoyable."

    content: "Passion proves to be a skill that is in high demand, no matter what career you are in. I look forward to bringing my passion to a field that Iâ€™ve been intrigued in for a while. I plan on finding a team environment where communication is key. Technology is a career that constantly changes and requires adaptability from those in the field. Similar to my previous career, a person is required to be continually learning, growing from feedback, and adapting to the times. I feel confident that, though my past varies from my future, many of my skills will translate clearly."
